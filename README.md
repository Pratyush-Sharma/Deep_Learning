# Deep_Learning from Scratch

This repository contains various machine learning/deep learning models and algorithms from scratch.

## Install
These projects requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You will also need to have **Tensorflow** installed and a software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.
